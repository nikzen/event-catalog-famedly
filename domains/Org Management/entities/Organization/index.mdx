## Overview

`Organization` is owned by the **Org Management** domain. On creation it starts in `provisioning` with `idpReady=false`. 

After Zitadel provisioning completes (via Identity Integration), it transitions to `active` with `idpReady=true`.

### Entity Properties
<EntityPropertiesTable />

## Relationships

* **Identity Integration Service**: provisions Zitadel for this org.  
* **Events**: produced `orgmgmt.organization.created`; consumed `identity.zitadel.organizationCreated` to set `idpReady=true`.
