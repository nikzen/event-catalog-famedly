## Overview

When a new org is created, this service invokes an **external Deployment Webhook** (payload: orgId, slug, config).  
It receives a **transaction-id** and emits `deployment.requestAccepted`.  
Once the external platform signals completion (webhook/callback/polling), it emits `deployment.instanceDeployed` (or `deployment.failed`).
